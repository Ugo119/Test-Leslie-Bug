  <h3>Professional Work Experience</h3>
  <h3> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=edukoya&c=apps">Edukoya</a> </h3>
  <p>Oct, 2021 - Date</p>
  <p>An educational android app, with over <strong>100K</strong> downloads,<strong>10K</strong> daily active users <br>
    and a <strong>4.4</strong> rating on the Google play store.
  </p>
  <p>
    Led a distributed android team to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Build Edukoya Quiz feature that enables students to answer random questions
      on a subject within a <br>stipulated time frame . This improved the Daily Active
      Usage and retention rate by over 55%.
    </li>
    <li>Integrate billing feature using Paystack API to enable users to pay for tutor sessions</li>
    <li>Design, architect and implement analytics feature to track app events and
      collect data, improving decision making.
    </li>
    <li>Create the custom image upload feature which has improved communication
      between student and tutor by over 60%.
    </li>
    <li>Optimize our Git branching strategy for the codebase in order to accommodate
      the 2 different releases <br>on playstore - production and closed beta.
    </li>
    <li>Adopt test driven development to test and deploy highly scalable software.</li>
    <li>Modify an in-house stand alone SVG-editor app to help tutors format questions
      with illustrations thus reducing <br>errors in the main app by over 90%.
    </li>
    <li>Reduce the number and frequency of crash activities to almost 1 ANR in 3,000 cases.</li>
    <li>Establish a protocol for timely review of codebase thus cleaning up the agile
      board and reducing the number of <br>tickets in “Code review” by over 95%.
    </li>
    <li>Support team members in troubleshooting and resolving issues using my critical thinking skills.</li>
    <li>Collaborate with Product Manager, User Interface and User Experience specialists
      to create stable code with core <br>android technologies.
    </li>
    <li>Integrate Twillio into the application for instant messaging.
    </li>
    <li>Co-create the initiative for team knowledge sharing sessions. This helped
      promote the Company culture of collaboration <br>and also helped engineers to
      improve their technical knowledge, confidence and problem solving skills.
    </li>
    <li>Supervise onboarding of new engineers to the team.</li>
  </ul>
